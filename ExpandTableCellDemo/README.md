This Sample shows how to create a expandable and collapsible cell in UITableView

Lets walk through the example.
I have UITableView with custom UITableViewCell called customCell with identifier as Cell and Style as custom. Cell is design in Storyboard within the UITableView by adding UITableViewCell.

My customCell has 2 UIView - FirstView and SecondView. FirstView is one which will be displayed in collapsible or normal mode and when user clicks on a cell it expands to show SecondView below FirstView.
